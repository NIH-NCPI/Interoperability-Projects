# <p align=center> AnVIL/Velsera-CGC interoperability project to study the genetic and transcriptomic contributions towards Hispanic colorectal cancer health disparities </p>

## Project Description
The AnVIL/Velsera-CGC Interoperability Project seeks to enhance data interoperability by integrating genomic datasets from the 1000 Genomes Project on AnVIL with cancer-specific datasets from the Velsera Cancer Genomics Cloud. The project involves harmonizing data formats and developing workflows to facilitate data integration and analysis. Scientifically, by addressing the ancestry bias in human genetics, the project aims to improve the understanding of genetic and transcriptomic variations linked to colorectal cancer, particularly in the context of observed increased Hispanic rates of colorectal cancer. These efforts will enable researchers to access and analyze diverse datasets more effectively, supporting more accurate and comprehensive research outcomes.
