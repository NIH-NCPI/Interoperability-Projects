# <p align=center> Connecting FHIR, the CDA, and DRS Across NIH Cloud Resources </p>

## Project Description
The project focuses on developing a FHIR aggregator to improve data interoperability and access across NIH consortia. By creating a comprehensive index of FHIR endpoints, the aggregator will enable researchers to identify and retrieve relevant biological samples and datasets. The project builds on the Cancer Data Aggregator model, extending its capabilities to non-cancer resources using a common data model. Initial efforts include integrating genomic data and experimental datasets into FHIR, facilitating easier access and mapping of diverse data types. These advancements will support more efficient and comprehensive research analyses across various biomedical domains.
