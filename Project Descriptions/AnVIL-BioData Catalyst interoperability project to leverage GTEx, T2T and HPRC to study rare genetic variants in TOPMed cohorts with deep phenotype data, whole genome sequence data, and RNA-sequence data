# <p align=center> AnVIL-BioData Catalyst interoperability project to leverage GTEx, T2T and HPRC to study rare genetic variants in TOPMed cohorts with deep phenotype data, whole genome sequence data, and RNA-sequence data </p>

## Project Description
The AnVIL-BioData Catalyst Interoperability Project focuses on integrating GTEx, T2T, and HPRC datasets to improve the study of rare genetic variants within TOPMed cohorts. The project involves utilizing the Watershed probabilistic model to identify rare variants and reprocessing datasets with the T2T reference genome to discover new variants. Additionally, the project will perform preliminary testing with the Human Pangenome Reference and assess the trait impact of these rare variants using harmonized phenotypes in BDC for TOPMed. A key component of the project is dockerizing the Watershed model and associated pipelines for use by other research groups. This will enhance the analysis of structural variants and streamline data integration, making it easier for researchers to leverage these comprehensive datasets and identify rare variants.
